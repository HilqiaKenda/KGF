    <h2>About Burger</h2>
    <p>
        A burger is a patty of ground beef grilled and placed between two halves of a bun. Slices of raw onion, lettuce, bacon, mayonnaise, and other ingredients add flavor.  
        Burgers are considered an American food but are popular around the world. In Japan, teriyaki burgers are popular. In India, vegetarian burgers are created using potato and mint instead of a meat patty.    
        Regardless of its content, a burger should always be properly cooked to be safe. Rare burgers carry the risk of bacterial infection and food poisoning. <br>

    <h3>Ingredians</h3>
    <p>
        First of all, typical hamburgers contain no ham. The patty is often made from ground beef. If you order a buffalo burger in the U.S., there's no buffalo in there, either. The patty is made from bison meat, which is generally considered healthier. Other options to make a burger are ground turkey or chicken meat. Vegetarian and vegan options include patties made of potatoes, black beans, or chickpeas.

        Most burgers at restaurants or fast food outlets contain beef. The beef is ground and shaped into a patty. This patty is grilled and placed between the halves of a sesame seed bun. The process for making a burger from bison or turkey meat is similar. <br>

        Hamburgers Nutrition Facts
        Burgers are available in many types and sizes. The nutritional values are different depending on weight and type of ingredients. As an example, a McDonald's hamburger 100-gram portion contains: 
        <ul>
            <li>263 calories</li>
            <li>13.3 grams protein</li>
            <li>10.2 grams fat</li>
            <li>29.6 grams carbohydrates</li>
            <li>1.8 grams fiber</li>
            <li>5.95 grams sugar</li>
            Burgers are often available, though, with options like a double patty and quarter-pound patties. These will have more calories and other nutritional values. 
    </ul>
